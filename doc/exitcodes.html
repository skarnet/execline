<h1> How to propagate exit codes up a process dynasty </h1>

<p>
 Say we have a parent process <em>P</em>, child of a grandparent process
<em>G</em>, spawning a child process <em>C</em> and waiting for it.
Either <em>C</em> dies normally with an exit code from 0 to 255, or it is
killed by a signal.
 How can we make sure that <em>P</em> reports to <em>G</em> what happened
to <em>C</em>, with as much precision as possible?
</p>

<p>
 The problem is, there's more information in a wstat (the
structure filled in by
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/waitpid.html">waitpid()</a>)
than a process can report by
simply exiting. <em>P</em> could exit with the same exit code as <em>C</em>,
but then what should it do if C has been killed by a signal?
</p>

<p>
 An idea is to have <em>P</em> kill itself with the same signal that killed
<em>C</em>.
But that's actually not right, because <em>P</em> itself could be killed by a
signal from another source, and G needs that information. "<em>P</em> has been
killed by a signal" and "<em>C</em> has been killed by a signal" are two
different pieces of information, so they should not be reported in the same way.
</p>

<p>
 So, any way you look at it, there is always more information than we
can report.
</p>

<p>
Shells have their own
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_08_02">convention</a>
for reporting crashes, but since any exit code greater than 127 is reported
as is, the information given by the shell is unreliable: "child exited 129"
and "child was killed by SIGHUP" are indistinguishable. When shells get
nested, all bets are off - the information conveyed by exit codes becomes
devoid of meaning pretty fast. We need something better.
</p>

<h2> execline's solution </h2>

<p>
execline commands such as <a href="if.html">if</a>, that can report
a child's exit code, proceed that way when they're in the position of
<em>P</em>:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> If <em>C</em> was killed by a signal: <em>P</em> exits 128 plus the
signal number. </li>
 <li> If <em>C</em> exited 128 or more: <em>P</em> exits 128. </li>
 <li> Else, <em>P</em> exits with the same code as <em>C</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Rationale:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> 128+ exit codes are extremely rare and should report really
problematic conditions; commands usually exit 127 or less. If <em>C</em>
exits 128+, it's more important to convey the information
"something really bad happened, but the <em>C</em> process itself was not
killed by a signal" than the exact nature of the event. </li>
 <li> Commands following that convention can be nested. If <em>P</em> exits
129+, <em>G</em> knows that <em>C</em> was
killed by a signal. If <em>G</em> also needs to report that to its parent,
it will exit 128: <em>G</em>'s parent will not know the signal number, but
it will know that <em>P</em> reported 128 or more, so either <em>C</em> or
a scion of <em>C</em> had problems. </li>
 <li> Exact information is reported in the common case. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Summary of common exit codes for execline programs </h2>

<ul>
 <li> 0: success. This code is rarely encountered, because most execline
programs chainload into something else when they succeed, instead of exiting 0. </li>
 <li> 100: wrong usage </li>
 <li> 111: system call failed </li>
 <li> 126: unable to chainload into another program (any other error than ENOENT) </li>
 <li> 127: unable to chainload into another program (executable not found) </li>
</ul>
