 This package assumes the existence of a POSIX shell in /bin/sh.
 On Solaris, /bin/sh is not POSIX. Most versions of Solaris provide
a POSIX shell in /usr/xpg4/bin/sh.

 To compile this package on Solaris, you will need to run

     ./patch-for-solaris

 before you run ./configure. This script will change the #! invocation
of the configure script and various tools so that a POSIX shell is used
for the compilation process.
